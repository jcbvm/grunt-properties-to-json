A grunt plugin for converting java property files to JSON files.

## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-properties-to-json --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-properties-to-json');
```

## Usage

With the following config, each `.properties` file in src will be converted to json and will be saved as a `.json` file in the same directory as the property file.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    propertiesToJSON: {
        main: {
            src: ['path/to/properties/files', 'another/path/to/properties/files']
        }
    }
});
```

It is also possible to define a destination folder for the generated json files:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    propertiesToJSON: {
        main: {
            src: ['path/to/properties/files', 'another/path/to/properties/files'],
            dest: 'tmp'
        }
    }
});
```

#### Split keys by a separator

You can split keys in the property files by using the `splitKeysBy` option (a string or regular expression). With this option the keys in the property files will be splitted by the given string or regular expression and used as nested keys in the JSON output.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    propertiesToJSON: {
        main: {
            src: ['path/to/properties/files', 'another/path/to/properties/files'],
            dest: 'tmp',
            options: {
                splitKeysBy: '.'
            }
        }
    }
});
```

#### Include and/or exclude keys

You can explicitly `include` and/or `exclude` namespaces, effectively whitelisting or blacklisting. For each option, provide a string, regular expression or an array of strings and regular expressions. If both options are used, exclusions are applied first, then inclusions. If you combine this option with `splitKeysBy` you can include and/or exclude nested keys by respectively setting the `deepInclude` or `deepExclude` option to `true`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    propertiesToJSON: {
        main: {
            src: ['path/to/properties/files', 'another/path/to/properties/files'],
            dest: 'tmp',
            options: {
                splitKeysBy: '.',
                exclude: ['message', /label$/],
                deepExclude: true
            }
        }
    }
});
```

#### Merge multiple property files to one JSON file

If you want multiple property files to be merged to one JSON file, you can set the `merge` option to `true`. The destination should be a file in which the merged JSON output will be written. You can combine this option with the options mentioned above (the merge will be applied as last operation, so splitted keys will also be merged).

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    propertiesToJSON: {
        main: {
            src: ['path/to/properties/files', 'another/path/to/properties/files'],
            dest: 'tmp.json',
            options: {
                merge: true
            }
        }
    }
});
```
